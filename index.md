### Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant
Welcome to my academic website! I am a PhD candidate under the prestigious Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS) at the Department of Mathematics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on inverse problems, partial differential equations (PDEs), numerical analysis, and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and Inverse Scattering Problems (ISP).

### Research Focus
- **Inverse Problems**: Developing innovative solutions for nonlinear ill-posed EIT and ISP
- **Deep Learning & Learning Theory**: Enhancing model performance through theoretical frameworks
- **Operator Learning & PDEs**: Advancing computational solutions for complex differential equations
- **Scientific Computing**: High-performance implementations and parallel computing
- **Image Reconstruction**: Algorithm development for high-quality imaging
- **Optimization**: Advanced methods for computational efficiency

### Technical Expertise
- Programming Languages: Python, MATLAB
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Specialties: Adaptive Methods, Parallel Computing

### Current Work
I'm bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications in computational mathematics, focusing on:
- Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)
- Inverse Scattering Problems (ISP)
- Operator Learning for PDEs
- Deep Learning Applications in Inverse Problems
