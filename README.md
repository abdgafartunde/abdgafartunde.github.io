## Installation (jekyll-remote-theme method)

You can use this theme with the `jekyll-remote-theme` plugin. Just create an empty repo, copy over the `index.html` file and add this to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: niklasbuschmann/contrast@v2.11

plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
```

Note: to enable icons you also need to copy over the `_data` folder.

## Config

Your `_config.yml` could for example look like this:

```yaml
title: "Blog Title"
author: "Blog Author"
description: "My personal blog about ... something"
permalink: /:title/
lang: "en"
excerpt_separator: "\n\n\n"
date_format: "%B %d, %Y"

# Layout

show_frame: true           # adds a gray frame to the site
show_sidebar: false        # show a sidebar instead of the usual header

# Menu

navigation:                # accepts {file, title, url, icon, sidebaricon}
  - {file: "index.html"}
