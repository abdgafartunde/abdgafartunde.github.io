## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at JJJ University. My work focuses on Inverse Problems, Computational and Applied Mathematics, Deep Learning, and Numerical Analysis.

### Background

- **Education**: PhD in Mathematics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (2021–2025)
- **Research Experience**: Doctoral research on variational regularization and physics-informed deep learning for Electrical Impedance Tomography
- **International Experience**: Visiting Researcher, University of Graz (2023–2024)

### Research Focus

I develop principled algorithms at the intersection of numerical optimization and machine learning for imaging and inverse problems, emphasizing stability, efficiency, and reproducibility.

### Beyond Research

When I'm not working, I enjoy reading, mentoring students, and learning new tools in scientific computing.
