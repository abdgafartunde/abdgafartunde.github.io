## Professional Profile

As a mathematical scientist at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I work at the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging. My research journey is driven by a passion for developing innovative solutions that bridge theoretical mathematics with real-world healthcare applications.

## Academic Background

Under the supervision of Professor Jun Zou at CUHK, I'm developing novel approaches to solve complex inverse problems in medical imaging. My work is supported by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS).

## Research Philosophy

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems. By combining rigorous mathematical theory with modern computational methods, my work aims to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of deep learning in medical imaging.

## Collaboration Interests

I'm particularly interested in collaborations that:
- Bridge theoretical mathematics with practical applications
- Advance medical imaging technologies
- Develop innovative deep learning architectures
- Explore new approaches to inverse problems
