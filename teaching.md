## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach integrates three core principles: conceptual understanding, practical application, and inclusive engagement. I emphasize the fundamental connections between mathematical theory and real-world applications, while fostering an interactive learning environment that accommodates diverse learning styles. By combining rigorous mathematical foundations with practical examples, I help students develop both analytical skills and intuitive understanding of complex mathematical concepts.
