## Research Overview

My research focuses on developing computational and machine learning approaches for solving inverse problems in applied mathematics. I work at the intersection of numerical analysis, optimization, and deep learning to create robust algorithms for medical imaging and scientific computing applications.

### Research Areas

**Inverse Problems & Regularization**  
Developing variational inversion frameworks using optimization methods to address ill-posedness and nonlinearity for parameter identification and image reconstruction. Focus on multi-parameter regularizers, convex optimization, and data-driven regularization.

**Medical Imaging**  
Advancing reconstruction techniques for real-time medical imaging applications including electrical impedance tomography (EIT), inverse scattering problems (ISP), and full-waveform inversion (FWI). Emphasis on partial measurement scenarios and real-time processing.

**Scientific Machine Learning**  
Integrating deep neural networks with physics-based models to improve accuracy and robustness. Research includes physics-informed neural networks, deep learning for image reconstruction, and neural ODE methods.

**Numerical Methods**  
Developing efficient numerical algorithms for differential equations and optimization problems, including finite element methods, iterative optimization algorithms, and high-performance computing implementations.

### Current Projects

**Physics-Informed Deep Learning for EIT** (2022-present)  
Developing hybrid models combining physics-based constraints with deep learning architectures for improved EIT reconstruction, achieving 15% accuracy improvement over traditional methods in noisy environments.
