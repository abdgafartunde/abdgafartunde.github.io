Now that I've completed my PhD at The Chinese University of Hong Kong and transitioned to my postdoctoral position, I want to share reflections on this transformative journey from Nigeria to Hong Kong.

## From Minna to Hong Kong

My path began at the Federal University of Technology Minna, where I earned my B.Tech in Mathematics (First Class Honours). Working as a research assistant at Kano University of Science and Technology afterward sparked my interest in computational mathematics for real-world problems.

Moving from Nigeria to Hong Kong in August 2021 meant leaving everything familiar behind. But the opportunity to work with Professor Jun Zou on electrical impedance tomography was compelling.

## The Research

My dissertation, "Novel regularization and deep learning approaches for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problems with partial measurement data," tackled a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. Key contributions include:

- Adaptive primal-dual hybrid gradient methods for variational inversion
- Integration of deep neural networks with physics-based models
- Data-driven approaches achieving 15% improvement in reconstruction accuracy on noisy, incomplete datasets

## Nine Months in Austria

In October 2023, I received the Ernst Mach Grant for a visiting research position at the University of Graz. This experience was transformative—I developed GPU-accelerated TensorFlow models and collaborated with researchers from diverse backgrounds. The exposure to different research methodologies shaped how I approach problems today.

## Lessons Learned

A PhD is challenging. Failed experiments, rejected papers, and isolation as an international student tested my resilience. But these difficulties taught me valuable lessons:

- **Embrace uncertainty** — Research means exploring the unknown
- **Build support networks** — Academic mentors and personal friends are both essential
- **Take opportunities** — My Austria visit pushed me outside my comfort zone but paid dividends
- **Celebrate small wins** — A PhD is a marathon, not a sprint

## Community and Leadership

Serving as Secretary and Vice President of the SIAM Student Chapter at CUHK was unexpectedly rewarding. Co-organizing workshops showed me that research is about building knowledge collectively, not just individual achievement.

## Looking Back

The late nights, breakthrough moments, conferences, and friendships—they've all shaped who I am. To my family in Nigeria, my supervisors, and collaborators worldwide: thank you for being part of this journey.
