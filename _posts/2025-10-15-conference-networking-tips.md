Academic conferences can be intimidating, especially for first-time attendees. After attending SIAM meetings and specialized workshops, here are the strategies that have worked for me.

## Before You Go

**Research the program:**
- Identify 3-5 talks directly related to your research
- Note potential collaborators
- Mark poster sessions and social events

**Prepare your elevator pitch** (30 seconds):
> "I'm Abd'gafar, a postdoc at Jilin University working on electrical impedance tomography. I develop deep learning methods for medical imaging with incomplete data."

## During the Conference

**Be strategic with sessions:**
- Prioritize your research area but attend one session outside your field
- Don't hesitate to skip a talk for a good conversation

**At talks and posters:**
- Ask thoughtful questions during Q&A
- Approach speakers afterward with specific comments
- Spend quality time at fewer posters rather than rushing through many

**At social events:**
- Don't just stick with people you know
- Everyone is there to network—people expect to be approached

## Making Connections Last

**Follow up within 48 hours:**
- Reference your conversation specifically
- Include something valuable: a paper, resource, or introduction
- Suggest concrete next steps

## What Success Looks Like

- A casual conversation at SIAM led to my visiting position in Austria
- A poster session interaction resulted in a collaboration and submitted paper
- An early-career mixer introduced me to my current workshop co-organizers

The key is genuine interest in others' work. The best networking doesn't feel like networking.
