After four transformative years at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I am thrilled to embark on a new chapter as a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematics, Jilin University in Changchun, China. This transition marks not just a geographic move, but a significant step in my academic career.

## Why Jilin University?

Jilin University has a strong tradition in applied mathematics and computational science. The School of Mathematics offers an excellent environment for continuing my research on inverse problems while expanding into new directions. The collaborative atmosphere and access to cutting-edge computational resources were major factors in my decision.

## Research Directions

My postdoctoral research will build upon my PhD work while exploring new frontiers:

**Continuing Themes:**
- Physics-informed neural networks for inverse problems
- Regularization theory for ill-posed problems
- Real-time medical imaging algorithms

**New Explorations:**
- Multi-physics inverse problems
- Uncertainty quantification in learned reconstructions
- Applications to geophysical imaging

## Adapting to a New Environment

Moving from Hong Kong to Changchun presents its own set of adjustments. The climate is dramatically different – I'm experiencing my first true northern Chinese winter! The research culture also has its own rhythm, and I'm enjoying learning from colleagues with diverse perspectives.

## Looking Forward

The postdoc phase is a unique time in an academic career – a period of relative independence to develop one's research identity while still having mentorship. I plan to use this time to:

1. Publish impactful research in top journals
2. Build international collaborations
3. Develop new computational tools for the research community
4. Mentor graduate students

I'm grateful for this opportunity and excited about what lies ahead. Stay tuned for updates on my research progress!
