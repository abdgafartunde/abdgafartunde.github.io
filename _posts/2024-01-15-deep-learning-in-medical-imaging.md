As a researcher working at the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging, I've observed that successful implementation goes far beyond just understanding the algorithms. Here are some key insights from my research journey:

## The Mathematical Foundation Matters

While deep learning often seems like a black box, its success in medical imaging heavily relies on solid mathematical principles. In my work with Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), understanding the underlying inverse problem theory has been crucial for:

- Developing stable reconstruction methods
- Choosing appropriate regularization strategies
- Ensuring convergence of learned algorithms

## Practical Challenges in Healthcare Applications

Real-world implementation presents unique challenges:
- Balancing reconstruction speed with accuracy
- Ensuring robustness against noise
- Meeting clinical requirements
- Maintaining interpretability of results
