As I approach the final stretch of my PhD journey at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I find myself reflecting on the incredible path that brought me here from Nigeria. It's been a transformative experience filled with challenges, discoveries, and growth that I never could have imagined when I first stepped foot on campus in August 2021.

## The Beginning: From Minna to Hong Kong

My journey began at the Federal University of Technology in Minna, where I earned my B.Tech in Mathematics with First Class Honours. Those formative years instilled in me a deep appreciation for mathematical rigor and problem-solving. But it was during my time as a research assistant at Kano University of Science and Technology that I first glimpsed the potential of computational mathematics to solve real-world problems.

The decision to pursue a PhD abroad was not taken lightly. Moving from Nigeria to Hong Kong meant leaving behind family, friends, and familiar surroundings. However, the opportunity to work with Professor Jun Zou at CUHK and delve into the fascinating world of electrical impedance tomography was too compelling to pass up.

## The Research: Diving into Inverse Problems

My dissertation focuses on "Novel regularization and deep learning approaches for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problems with partial measurement data." For those unfamiliar with EIT, it's a non-invasive imaging technique that can see inside objects (including the human body) by measuring electrical signals at the boundary.

The mathematical challenges are immense. EIT is what we call an "ill-posed inverse problem" – small errors in measurements can lead to wildly different reconstructions. My work has involved developing:

- Novel variational inversion schemes using adaptive primal-dual hybrid gradient methods
- Integration of deep neural networks with physics-based models
- Data-driven approaches for learning regularizers

One of my proudest achievements has been improving reconstruction accuracy by 15% in noisy and incomplete measurement datasets. It might not sound like much, but in medical imaging, such improvements can be the difference between detecting a condition early or missing it entirely.

## The Austrian Chapter: A Transformative Experience

In October 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to spend nine months at the University of Graz in Austria, funded by the Ernst Mach Grant. This visiting research period was transformative in ways I hadn't anticipated.

Working with the team in Graz exposed me to different research methodologies and collaborative approaches. I developed GPU-accelerated TensorFlow models for real-time imaging and collaborated with researchers from diverse backgrounds. The experience taught me that good research often happens at the intersection of different perspectives and expertise.

Austria also challenged me personally. Navigating a new culture, learning basic German, and adapting to European academic customs pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best possible way.

## Challenges and Growth

Let's be honest – a PhD is not easy. There were moments of doubt, failed experiments, and papers that came back with devastating reviews. I remember spending weeks on a particular algorithm only to discover a fundamental flaw that sent me back to the drawing board.

The isolation of research can be particularly challenging for international students. Video calls with family back home helped, but there's nothing quite like the feeling of being thousands of miles away when things get tough.

However, these challenges have been my greatest teachers. They've taught me resilience, the importance of seeking help when needed, and the value of celebrating small victories along the way.

## The Community: More Than Just Research

One of the unexpected joys of my PhD has been the community I've found. The SIAM Student Chapter at CUHK has been particularly meaningful. Serving as Secretary and now Vice President has taught me leadership skills and allowed me to give back to the academic community.

Co-organizing workshops and conferences has shown me that research is not just about individual achievement – it's about building knowledge collectively and supporting the next generation of researchers.

## Looking Forward

As I prepare to defend my dissertation in 2025, I'm filled with both excitement and anticipation about what comes next. The skills I've developed – not just in mathematics and programming, but in project management, international collaboration, and scientific communication – have prepared me for whatever path I choose.

Whether in academia or industry, I'm committed to using mathematical tools to solve problems that matter. The techniques I've developed for EIT have potential applications in medical imaging, materials science, and beyond.

## Advice for Future PhD Students

For those considering a similar journey, here's what I wish I had known:

1. **Embrace the uncertainty** – Research is fundamentally about exploring the unknown
2. **Build a support network** – Both academic mentors and personal friends are crucial
3. **Don't be afraid to take opportunities** – My time in Austria was outside my comfort zone but incredibly rewarding
4. **Celebrate small wins** – A PhD is a marathon, not a sprint
5. **Stay connected to your "why"** – Remember what motivated you to start this journey

## Final Thoughts

As I write this from my office in Hong Kong, looking out at the campus where I've spent the last three and a half years, I'm grateful for every moment of this journey. The late nights in the lab, the breakthrough moments, the conferences, the friendships, the challenges – they've all contributed to who I am today.

To my family back in Nigeria, my supervisors, collaborators, and friends around the world – thank you for being part of this incredible journey. The best is yet to come.
